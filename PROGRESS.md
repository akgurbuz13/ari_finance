## Recent Session Work (2026-02-15)

### Context
A security review identified 22 findings across the backend. Another AI agent attempted fixes for ~12 of them, but 3 were incorrect/incomplete. This session corrects those mistakes, adds RBAC support, fixes infrastructure gaps, and updates documentation.

### Work Completed

#### Phase 1: Fix Incorrect AI Agent Changes
- **ReconciliationService**: Fixed wrong table name (`ledger.ledger_entries` -> `ledger.entries`), wrong columns (`entry_type` -> `direction`, `reference` -> `reference_id`), added missing JOIN to `ledger.transactions`
- **MasakReportingService**: Changed `LEFT JOIN` to `JOIN` for account lookups (4 places) — completed payment orders always have sender/receiver accounts
- **InternalSettlementController**: Fixed metadata type fragility — store `"true"` (String) instead of `true` (Boolean), use `?.toString() == "true"` for JSONB round-trip safety

#### Phase 2: RBAC / Admin Role System
- New migration `V016__add_user_role.sql` — adds `role` column with `DEFAULT 'USER'` and CHECK constraint
- Updated `User` model with `role` field
- Updated `UserRepository`: role in rowMapper, save(), update(), new `updateRole()` method
- Updated `AuthService.generateTokens()`: uses `user.role` instead of hardcoded `"USER"` for JWT roles

#### Phase 3: Infrastructure & K8s Fixes
- Activated `external-secrets.yaml` in kustomization base
- Added managed service `ipBlock` egress rules (PostgreSQL + Redis) to both core-banking and blockchain-service network policies
- Removed mutable `:latest` tag from deploy workflow (only immutable `${{ github.ref_name }}` remains)
- Added single-replica rationale comment to blockchain-service deployment

#### Phase 4: Documentation Cleanup
- Fixed ARCHITECTURE.md: Kong -> nginx ingress, updated rate limiting description (Bucket4j in-app)
- Annotated V008 sanctions seed data as test fixtures only
- Updated PROGRESS.md with this session's work

## Recent Session Work (2026-02-05)

### Context
After initial implementation of Phases 1-5, a comprehensive review revealed that the blockchain service layer had significant gaps between the Solidity contracts and Kotlin service wrappers. A focused effort was undertaken to complete all blockchain-related work.

### Work Completed

#### Priority 1: Bug Fixes ✅
- Fixed `OutboxPollerService` method name mismatch (`initiateCrossChainTransfer` → `initiateBridgeTransfer`)
- Added `getBridgeOperatorCredentials()` to `CustodialWalletService`
- Created `V013__fix_blockchain_operations.sql` migration (operation constraints + metadata column)
- Added `metadata` field to `BlockchainTransaction` entity
- Added `findByTransferId()` and `findPendingBridgeTransfers()` repository methods

#### Priority 2: Kotlin Wrappers ✅
- Rewrote `OvaBridgeAdapterContract` with correct Solidity method signatures
- Created `OvaTokenHomeContract` wrapper (`bridgeTokens`, `registerRemote`, daily limits)
- Created `OvaTokenRemoteContract` wrapper (`bridgeBack`, `registerHomeChain`, allowlist)
- Updated `ContractFactory` with new contract factories
- Updated `BlockchainConfig` with TokenHome/TokenRemote addresses

#### Priority 3: Deployment Scripts ✅
- Enhanced `deploy.ts` for TokenHome/TokenRemote deployment
- Created `deploy-dual-chain.ts` for TR + EU L1 orchestration
- Created `configure-bridge.ts` for cross-chain registration

#### Priority 4: Comprehensive Tests ✅
- Created `MockTeleporter.sol` for testing ICTT bridge without network
- Created `OvaTokenHome.test.ts` (37 test cases)
- Created `OvaTokenRemote.test.ts` (comprehensive coverage)
- Created `OvaBridgeAdapter.test.ts` (full integration tests)
- Created `IcttBridgeServiceTest.kt` (quote, transfer, status tracking)
- Created `MintServiceTest.kt` (mint operations, allowlist, errors)
- Created `BurnServiceTest.kt` (burn operations, errors, network handling)
- **Total: 115 Solidity tests + 12 Kotlin tests passing**

#### Priority 5: AWS Testing Infrastructure ✅
- Created `infra/terraform/environments/dev/validators.tf` (2 validators per L1)
- Created `scripts/bootstrap-validators.sh` (key generation, Secrets Manager, Terraform)
- Created `scripts/deploy-contracts.sh` (dual-chain deployment)
- Created `scripts/e2e-bridge-test.sh` (full TR→EU transfer test)
- Created `.env.aws-test.example` template
- Created `scripts/README.md` documentation

2. **Create L1 chains** — Manual avalanche-cli commands
3. **Deploy contracts** — Run `./scripts/deploy-contracts.sh both`
4. **Run E2E test** — Verify TR→EU transfer completes
5. **Schedule security audit** — External firm for backend + contracts
6. **Integrate real payment rails** — SEPA (EU) / FAST (TR) when partnerships ready
7. **Production deployment** — Both regions simultaneously
